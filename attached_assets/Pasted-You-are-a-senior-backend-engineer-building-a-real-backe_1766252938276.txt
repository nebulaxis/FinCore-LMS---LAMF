You are a senior backend engineer building a real backend for an existing LMS frontend (Loan Management System) for an NBFC offering Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF).

The frontend is already built and currently uses a mock API.
Your task is to replace the mock API with a real, production-style backend, suitable for an interview assignment.

🔧 TECH STACK (MANDATORY)

Node.js

Express.js

MongoDB with Mongoose

REST APIs

dotenv for config

cors enabled

🎯 CORE OBJECTIVE

Build a clean, modular, API-first backend that supports:

Loan Products

Loan Applications

Active Loans

Collateral (Mutual Funds)

Dashboard metrics

This backend must be deployable as a standalone service.

🧩 REQUIRED BACKEND MODULES (DO NOT SKIP)
1️⃣ Loan Products API

CRUD operations for loan products:

name

interestRate

maxLtv

minAmount

maxAmount

tenureMonths

2️⃣ Loan Applications API

Create new loan application (API-first, external fintech friendly)

Status flow:
SUBMITTED → APPROVED → DISBURSED → CLOSED

Validate requested amount against product rules

3️⃣ Loans API (Ongoing Loans)

Create loan when application is approved

Track:

sanctionedAmount

outstandingAmount

loanStatus (ACTIVE / CLOSED)

4️⃣ Collateral Management API

Attach mutual fund collateral to a loan

Fields:

fundName

isin

units

nav (dummy)

pledgedValue

5️⃣ Dashboard Summary API

Return aggregated metrics:

total loan applications

active loans count

total disbursed amount

total collateral value

🧠 SYSTEM DESIGN RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

Use modular folder structure:

/models
/controllers
/routes
/services
/config
app.js
server.js


Keep business logic in services

Controllers should be thin

Use proper HTTP status codes

Add minimal error handling

📘 DATABASE REQUIREMENTS

Use Mongoose schemas

Define relationships via ObjectId references

Include timestamps

Add sample seed data (optional)

🔐 AUTHENTICATION

Skip user auth

Assume single NBFC admin user

Mention this assumption in comments

🚀 DEPLOYMENT READINESS (MANDATORY)

App must run using:

npm install
npm run start


Use process.env.MONGO_URI and process.env.PORT

Add instructions for deploying to Render

Enable CORS for frontend integration

📄 README.md (MANDATORY)

Create or update README.md including:

Backend overview

API endpoint list with sample request/response

Database schema explanation

Environment variables

Local run instructions

Deployment steps (Render)

⚠️ IMPORTANT GUIDELINES

Do NOT implement frontend

Do NOT use mock APIs or in-memory storage

Keep code simple, readable, and interview-friendly

Comment important business logic

✅ FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTATION

A fully working backend that:

Can replace the existing mock API

Can be deployed publicly

Matches real fintech LMS expectations

Is easy to explain in an interview
