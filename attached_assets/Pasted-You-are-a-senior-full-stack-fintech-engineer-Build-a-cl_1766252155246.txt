You are a senior full-stack fintech engineer.
Build a clean, interview-ready, demo-level Loan Management System (LMS) for an NBFC providing Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF).

This is NOT a production system, but it must demonstrate clear system design, API-first architecture, and correct loan lifecycle understanding.

🔧 TECH STACK (MANDATORY)

Frontend: React (Vite or CRA)

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)

API style: REST, JSON

Auth: Skip or keep minimal (single admin assumption)

🎯 CORE BUSINESS SCOPE (VERY IMPORTANT)

This NBFC only provides Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF).
Mutual Funds act as collateral.

🧩 MODULES TO IMPLEMENT (EXACTLY THESE 5)
1️⃣ Loan Products

Create and list loan products

Fields:

name

interestRate

maxLtv

minAmount

maxAmount

tenureMonths

2️⃣ Loan Applications

Create loan applications

Status flow:

DRAFT → SUBMITTED → APPROVED → DISBURSED → CLOSED

Store applicant name, product, requested amount

3️⃣ Create New Loan Application (API-FIRST)

REST API to create loan application

Designed so external fintech companies can use it

Validate loan amount vs product limits

4️⃣ Ongoing Loans

Convert approved application into an active loan

Track:

sanctioned amount

outstanding amount

loan status (ACTIVE / CLOSED)

5️⃣ Collateral Management (Mutual Funds)

Track pledged mutual fund units per loan

Fields:

fundName

isin

units

nav (dummy/static)

pledgedValue

Linked to a loan

🧠 SYSTEM DESIGN GUIDELINES

Use modular backend structure:

models

controllers

routes

services (business logic)

Keep business logic out of controllers

Use clean REST endpoints

No unnecessary features (no accounting, no compliance engine)

📊 DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS (BASIC)

Create a simple dashboard API that returns:

total loan applications

active loans count

total disbursed amount

total collateral value

Frontend can show simple cards (no heavy charts required).

📘 README.md (MANDATORY – VERY IMPORTANT)

Create a clear and professional README.md including:

1. Project Overview

Explain:

What is LMS

What is LAMF

What this demo covers

2. Tech Stack Used
3. System Design & Assumptions

Include statements like:

Single NBFC admin user

Dummy NAV values

MongoDB used for demo scope

4. API Endpoints

Document all APIs with:

endpoint

method

request body

example response

5. Setup & Run Instructions

Step-by-step instructions to run locally.

⚠️ IMPORTANT RULES

Keep the code simple, readable, and interview-friendly

Do NOT over-engineer

Add comments where business logic is implemented

Focus on clarity over completeness

✅ FINAL GOAL

Deliver a fully working demo LMS that clearly demonstrates:

Loan lifecycle understanding

API-first design

Backend engineering maturity

Clear documentation
